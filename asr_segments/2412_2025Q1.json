Black Knight illustrated our international subsidiary performance. In the first quarter, revenue from our overseas subsidiary increased by 8.2% year over year, mainly due to the growing ICT services provided to the high-tech customers in the United States and the Southeast Asia market. In light of the global economic landscape change, we have observed business opportunity from the growing Taiwanese investment in the United States and saw projects in our pipeline mainly progressing as a result of the relocation of AI supply chain, including the AIDC construction. The Strong Telecom Global, our subsidiary in the United States, expanded our Arizona office in April, and launched a new office in May in Texas office to support business development. In addition, our business in Singapore, Vietnam, and Thailand all experienced double-digit revenue growth in the first quarter, largely driven by the providing ICT services for Taiwanese enterprise to build new factories in the Southeast Asia market. To support overseas business, we announced our investment, and we are also working with Taiwan to expand our investment in the new submarine cable system, E2A, in March. This trans-Pacific fiber optical network will connect the submarine cable system between North America and Asia. Our strategy is to enable diverse connectivity options, strengthen Taiwan's position as a key submarine cable hub in the Asia-Pacific region, and further enhance the overall network resilience to response to the global demand. Our technology will be able to support the development of the new submarine cable system, and enhance the overall network resilience to support the global demand.

In the first quarter, our CDG delivered a 4.9% year-over-year increase of its income before tax, which is quite healthy, as our mobile ARPU will steadily develop and fix broadband issues, and our ARPU is expected to continue to hold up. In addition, our ICT business continues to expand. We are delighted to see EDG's total revenue increase by 2.3% year-over-year, mainly underpinned by the strong ICT business revenue growth of 11.6% year-over-year. This growth was offset by a continued decline in EDG's fixed broadband business growth, which is quite healthy, and our ADG business is expected to continue to grow. Our APAC everytime's voice revenue, which staring the ... to a 3.8% year-over-year decrease in the income before tax, is helping the ESG growth to increase. Both increased modestly in the first quarter, due to its robust international IBC business growth and continued strong demand for the integrated ICT services in the global market.

Good afternoon, everyone. It is my pleasure to present an overview of our financial results for the first quarter of 2025. Please refer to slide 12, Income Statement Highlights. Let me walk you through the key financial metrics for the quarter. Revenue reached over $55 billion, making the fifth consecutive year of growth. This represents a year-over-year increase of 1.6%, driven primarily by the expansion of our ICT business, along with solid performance in mobile and broadband services. Income from operations and net income rose by 5% and 4.3%, respectively, compared to the same period last year. Income from operations and net income rose by 5%. Improvements were fueled by the strong performance of our IDC Internet Data Center business and sustained growth in mobile and video service subscriptions.

Notably, the growth in the cost of the business and net income increased by a significant percentage. This is a significant improvement in the performance of our business. Income from operations and net income increased by a significant percentage. This is a significant improvement in the performance of our business. Notably, both EBITDA and net income reached their highest level in nine years for a first quarter period, underscoring the resilience and strength of our core operations. Now let's turn to slide 13, balance sheet highlights. Total assets increased by 0.5% on March 31, 2025, compared to the year end 2024. The growth was primarily due to the increase in net income. The growth was primarily driven by an increase in other current monetary assets, which further strengthened our liquidity position. Property plan and equipment declined by 1.1%. As depreciation expense exceeded net additions of fixed assets during the quarter, this reflects our continued emphasis on capital discipline and asset efficiency. Total liability decreased by 5.5% mainly due to a reduction in accounts payable. Our current ratio improved further and remained above 100%, highlighting healthy short-term liquidity and financial flexibility. In addition, the debt ratio declined slightly, and net debt over EBITDA remains at zero. Taken together, these metrics highlight our solid financial position and prudent capital structure.

Importantly, we remain committed to disciplined capital management, and four-year mobile-related cap is still expected to be lower than in 2024. As a result of these factors, free cash flow declined by 17.4% year-over-year. This was in line with expectations. Given the investment timing, we continue to maintain a strong cash position and stable operating inflows, which provides a solid foundation to support business growth and shareholder return. So now let's turn to slide 15, performance relative to Q1 2025 guidance. For the first quarter of 2025, revenue was broadly in line with the guidance we provided earlier this year. Meanwhile, income from operations, net income, EPS, and EBITDA all surpass our Q1 guidance by a modest margin. This outperformance was primarily driven by the steady growth of our core business, improved profitability in our ICT business, and lower than expected operating costs, reflecting our ongoing efforts to optimize operation and maintain disciplined cost control.
