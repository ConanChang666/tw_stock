Ms. Tsai, please go ahead. Thank you. I'm Angela Tsai, Vice President of Financial Department. For Zhonghua Telecom, welcome to our second quarter 2025 result conference call. Joining me on the call today are our President, Zhong Shi Ling, and our Chief Financial Officer, Audrey Xu. During today's call, management will begin with the recent strategic achievements and provide an overview of our business in the second quarter, followed by a discussion of our segment performance in the financial results. After, we will move on to the question and answer portion of the call. On slide two, please read our disclaimers and notes concerning forward-looking statements. Now, I will turn the call over to President. President Ling, please go ahead. Thank you, Angela. And hello, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2025 result conference call. We are pleased to report our exceptional financial results with revenue operating income, net income, and EPS exceeded the upper end of our forecast. Both the second quarter and the first half of the year, second quarter revenue achieved and reached a 10-year high for the same period, fueled by the solid growth momentum of the core business and expanding ICT segment. Notably, ICT revenue also set a new record for any second quarters since 2021. These achievements underscore our strong commitment to innovation, operational excellence, and delivering sustained value to our stakeholders. Meanwhile, I'll continue to execute our Sea, Land, and Sky strategy to enhance network resilience and assist future opportunities. In July, we officially launched the Southeast Asia Japan Table 2, SAC2, enhancing network performance across the Asia-Pacific region, and supporting the rapid growth of bandwidth-intensive applications such as AI and cloud computing. In addition to the previously announced investment in E2A, the Trans-Pacific Undersea Cable connecting Asia to North America, we announced to invest in New Asia United Gateway AOG East Submarine Cable in July, which connects the Asia and East Submarine Cable. The new satellite is expected to bring in revenue after its completion in 2029. In terms of our multi-orbit satellite business, in the second quarter, China Telecom not only obtained the new exclusive commercial license for one-web LEO services, but also extended the satellite services to broader use, including the in-flight Wi-Fi services for aviation industry, and the applications for maritime industry. Moreover, for the land, we have partnered with NTT to successfully present the world's first cross-border core performance conducted in both Taiwan and Osaka, at the same time through IOWN, the old photonics network in EXPROS 2025, demonstrating the ultra-low latency of its application. Notably, we are also working with China to develop a new satellite system, which will be used in the future. We are honored to receive the highest MSCI ESG rating of AAA in May, the only Taiwan telecom to be recognized the highest rating, reflecting our strong performance in governance and data privacy and carbon management. We also earned the prestigious 2025 Taiwan Data Center Service Competitive Strategy Leadership Award from Fr. Sullivan. We are proud to be recognized as the top 5% of listed companies in Taiwan as well as the top 5% of listed companies in the world. In addition, our longstanding commitment to corporate governance was reaffirmed by the Taiwan Stock Exchange, which recognizes us as one of the top 5% of listed companies. Now, let's move on to the business overview of the second quarter of 2025. Please turn to page 5 to review our success in Taiwan Mobile. In the second quarter, we further strengthened our leadership position in Taiwan Mobile Market. According to the data from Taiwan's telecom regulator, our mobile market share rose to 40.7% as of June, reaching a new high. We also achieved the highest subscriber share among peers at 39.1%, driven by the continued growth of post-pay subscribers. Both revenue and subscriber shares increased year-over-year, highlighting our solid and sustained growth momentum. Our 5G market share reached 38.7%, maintaining our leading position in this segment, supported by robust network quality, the ongoing expansion of our subscriber base, and continued 5G migration. Mobile service revenue grew approximately 2% year-over-year. Additionally, the average monthly fee increased by 38% as more users upgraded to 5G, helping stabilize mobile approval, which delivered a modest quarter-over-quarter increase in the second quarter. Let's move on to slide 6 for an update of our outperforming fixed broadband business. In the second quarter, our fixed broadband revenue increased 1.8% year-over-year, driven by the success of our strategic bundle plan and our distinguished offering of symmetrical uplink and downlink speeds for service above 300 Mbps. Fixed broadband output also rose approximately 2% on years as well, representing an increase of 4.5%. In the second quarter, our fixed broadband revenue increased by 14 NT dollars per month, an encouraging sign of value expansion. Our cross-tier upgrade promotions, featuring bundled plans such as MOD, Wi-Fi, and streaming services, continue to perform well. Nearly 70% of adopters opted for plans with speeds of 300 Mbps and higher, including 1.8% of our fixed broadband revenue, including 1.8% of our fixed broadband revenue, including 1.8% of our fixed broadband revenue, including 1.8% of our fixed broadband revenue, including 1.8% of our fixed broadband revenue, including 1.8% of our fixed broadband revenue, including 1 Gbps services. As a result, the number of subscribers with speeds of 300 Mbps and above increased by 14% year-over-year, while those with speeds of 1 Gbps subscription multiplied impressively. Building on this momentum, we will continue promoting strategic bundling to support our upfront growth. We also plan to incentivize existing brand new bundle projects to top fixed broadband.

Slide 7 provides a deeper overview of highlights from our consumer application services. In the second quarter, we were pleased to see solid growth across all consumer service categories. Our multiple-player package, which integrates mobile fixed broadband and Wi-Fi services, achieved impressive year-over-year growth of 26%, marking it its 14th consecutive quarter of expansion. This momentum was largely driven by the successful launch of new fixed broadband promotion bundles in May.

While global market sentiment remains cautious amid ongoing uncertainty around tariffs and exchange rates, we continue to invest strategically for long-term growth in the United States, Japan, and Southeast Asia, in particular, we are targeting overseas AIDC-related construction projects for Taiwan-based high-tech firms, leveraging our proven capabilities in both air cooling and liquid cooling solutions. Now let's move on to the performance summary of our three business groups. As mentioned in the beginning, our revenue and profit performance were all better than expected. In line with the current market situation, in the second quarter, our CBG delivered a solid year-over-year increase of 4.8% in income before tax, driven by steady growth in both mobile and fixed broadband output. In addition to stable performance of our core service revenue, CBG also benefited from higher smartphone sales, as consumers accelerated their purchase. In anticipation of potential tariff fluctuation, our EBGs exceeded expectations with strong ICT performance. Total revenue rose 12% year-over-year, while ICT revenue grew even more significantly, up 37% year-over-year. As a result, EBG reported a robust 5.4% increase, in income before tax during this quarter. In contrast, our IBG fast headwinds revenue and income before tax both declined year-over-year, primarily due to softening demand for international fixed voice services and the decline in international roaming services. Now I would like to hand the call over to Audrey for financial updates. Thank you, President. Thank you, President. Thank you, President. Good afternoon, everyone. It's my pleasure to present an overview of our financial results for the second quarter of 2025. Let's turn to slide 12, income statement highlights. I will walk you through the key financial metrics for the second quarter of 2025. During the second quarter in 2025, revenue reached over $56 billion, making the fifth consecutive year of second quarter growth. . This represented 4.8% year-over-year increase, became geben, namely driven by the expansion, higher sales revenue. Income from operations and net income rose by 5.2% and 3.5%, respectively. Compared to the same period last year, this performance was supported by growth in our internet data center business, steady increase in mobile data where data is temporal rather than triggering and file data, and overall 4.8% year-over-e kiss. in mobile and stronger sales contribution from our subsidiary Zhonghua Precision Test Tech. Earnings per share increased from 1.27 to 1.31, reflecting consistent profitability and effective cost control. EPS reached their highest levels in nine years for a second quarter period, reflecting the continued strength of our core operations. EBITDA also recorded modest gains during the quarter. EBITDA increased by 3.5% year over year, reaching $22.58 billion for this quarter. The growth reflects continued operational efficiency and healthy cash generating ability across our core business. The EBITDA margin was 39.8%, remaining broadly stable compared to last year. So now, looking at the first half of 2025 in column 5 to column 8, revenue grew by 3.2% year over year, supported by momentum in our ICT business and strong performance of our subsidiary Zhonghua Precision Test Tech, which contributed to overall sales growth. Income from operations and net income rose by 5.1% and 3.9% respectively. These gains were driven by the ongoing growth of our IDC, and cloud services, along with steady performance from our subsidiaries. Earnings per share for the first half totaled NT 2.57. EBITDA increased by 3.4% year over year to NT 55.11 billion. The EBITDA margin was 40.09%, broadly in line with the same period last year. This replaced stable operational efficiency. Now, let's turn to slide 13, balance sheet highlights. Total assets increased by 1.9% as of June 30, 2025, compared to the year end 2024. This growth was primarily driven by an increase in other current monetary assets, which further strengthened our requisitive position.

If we exclude the effect of dividend payable, the adjusted debt ratio would be 23.15%. This would show a slight decrease compared to the year-end 2024. In addition, net debt to EBITDA remains at zero. Taken together, these indicators highlight our solid financial position and prudent capital structure. Moving to slide 14, cash flow summary. Cash flows from operating activities decreased by 0.2% year-over-year, primarily due to higher settlements of accounts payable in the first half of the quarter. Capital expenditures increased by 11.9% year-over-year, primarily due to the front-loaded deployment of 5G, 4G equipment in the first half of the year. While this resulted in temporary increase in capex, we continue to take a disciplined strategic approach to capital allocation, and four-year mobile-related capex will remain unchecked to be lower than in 2024. As a result of these factors, free cash flow declined by 6.8% year-over-year. This is in line with expectations. Given the investment timing, we continue to maintain a strong cash position and stable operating inflows, which provides a solid foundation to support business growth and shareholder returns. Now let's move to slide 15, performance relative to Q2 2025 guidance. During the second quarter of 2025, revenue exceeded our targets. Key performance measures, including income from operations, net income, APS, EBITDA, and EBITDA margin, all came in above guidance by modest margins. For the first half of 2025, revenue also outperformed expectations. In addition, income from operations, net income, EBITDA, and EBITDA margin all exceeded our internal forecast. These better-than-expected results were driven by the steady growth of our core business, enhanced profitability in our ICT, and strong sales opportunities. We also saw a significant increase in the growth of mobile phones and related products and lower than expected operating costs. This reflects our ongoing efforts to streamline operations and maintain disciplined cost control. That concludes our financial results for the second quarter.
